title: "xAI's Code of Conduct for Grok"
---

[According to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project), a code of conduct “define[s] community standards, signal[s] a welcoming and inclusive project, and outline[s] procedures for handling abuse.” Many such codes take on exactly these aims, yet fall short in spite of diligence and good intentions. Outlined community standards may still remain murky, attempts to be welcoming may alienate vast cohorts of well-meaning and talented contributors, and procedures for handling abuse may seem reasonable on paper and yet still fall short on enforcement, particularly given the limited attention open-source projects have available for nurturing their communities.

 

xAI’s Code of Conduct for Grok is not perfect, but it takes an elegant approach which avoids many of these common pitfalls. As such it is worth deep study by all who care deeply about the proper functioning of healthy, psychologically safe software organizations.
